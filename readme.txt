== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Why won't breadcrumbs show up? =
If you can't get the breadcrumbs to show up, please get support from the breadcrumb plugin author.
We cannot provide support for their plugins.
Also, keep in mind this only supports Yoast SEO Breadcrumbs and NavXT Breadcrumbs.  If you'd like
to see support for another breadcrumb plugin, please contact support and let us know!

= Q. Why can't I pick the field I want to show up? =
If you don't see the field that you want to appear in the list, then visit the "Display Settings",
and be sure that the field you want is set to display in the "Detail".
If you are using the Advanced Inventory Manager, currently the system does not allow you to pick fields
for each type.  If this would be helpful to you, let us know at support!
